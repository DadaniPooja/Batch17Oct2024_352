After a long time,so the long weekend is here with my frnds. Yeah we finally shut down our laptops  at the Friday evening , packed a small bag and headed out for a weekend escape. So yeah we needed a break from meetings, deadlines, and endless notifications.so nature is calling us to have fun together.

after our packing we decided to celebrate the beginning of our journey by lighting a few diyas and lamps around the apartment .

in the early morning Saturday we headed and caught a train to hill station.droping bags and fight with the window seats.hey wake up guys see this balcony view what a beautiful weather is it.

lets go and move around and have some picture. so this is the picture i have taken of my frnd who is very stressfree after her working days. And yeah its shows she is in peace. we found this hidden spot where we sat together and clicking pictures of each other. 

so by the time weekend is over, we felt renewed. we taken countless photos.

@ Successful Presentations(concise)

  - low presentation skills:
     = May know the subject: still unable to create the impact of the knowledge.
     = May have a need/requirement to present: but unsure about what works & what does not.
     = May understand things himself/herself : not capable of transferring to others
     = May not be motivated to take initiatives of many sorts.(volunteering-confidence and leadership skills)
     = May not be able to accomplish in interviews and meetings.(present yourself)
     = May receive negative feedback from the stakeholders(clients)
     = May result in loss of opportunities in span of a career.



 - when you present something to an audience - a technical topic, a general information , a process or any matter: The audience should value it.
   
----- STRUCTURE OF PRESENTATION
 1. Tell the audience what you are going to tell them
    - interesting & engaging
    - Opening line or statement - n\history, a quote, interesting questions, analogy, an interesting fact, etc.
    - Opening is Fundamental as it sets the Tone of the Presentation.(plot)


  2. Tell them
     - Interesting & engaging
     - Actual information, Concepts, key pints, etc.
     - Examples & practical approach- Audience oriented.

  
  3. Then tell what you have told them
     - Interesting and engaging
     - take away points and conclude it.


- middle of the presentation
   case study : real cases that happened
                brainstorm from that solution
                middle of the presentation
   

   swot analysis : strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats


- Get ready 
   - the delivery 
      = rate of speech: total no.of words while speaking English should be less than 90 words per minute.
      = Tone & pitch:
          Tone(courteous , professional, confident & positive)
          Pitch(should vary according to the information, neither too high nor too low) voice quality.  

    - points to consider
       = Difference between preparation & overthinking(what if)
       = How to use skills of storytelling in a presentation?
       = How to prepare a good introduction & conclusion?
       = Ways to engage audience

# 06/12/2024  session 7
(sentence correctness)
= live the life you have always imagined!
= Dream big, act bold, live fully.

3 reasons why errors occur
- when we translate from another lang verbatim.
- incorrect choice of voice
words which sound similar but have different meaning.


person 1 and person 4

single father have a strong sense of responsibility.his life experience could prove valuable for working with others to stay alive on the island. actually person with family responsibility often show strong perseverance in challenging situations.

author might not have survivial skills but he has the ability of thinking creatively and think critically. as he is a author he is good in problem solving. they have strong leadership qualities tht could help us if we get trouble in between.

person 3 having a medical knowelegde but she already cheated. so there could be trust issue within the group.if she is left there in the island she might helpful for the remaining people who are left over there. where she can prove herself if she wanted.

person 3 is almost seventy, with no stamina, physical health so his survivial is harder even though he's is survived.
and the he's already emotional losing his spouse. he is not capable to take care of himself so we cant take risks if any trouble comes where he can help us. my priority will be the younger individuals who can pyscially contribute to the group's needs.
